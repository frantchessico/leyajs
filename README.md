# Leyajs

Leyajs is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of initializing a new Node.js project. It automates tasks such as copying template files, installing dependencies, and running development scripts.

## Features

- Quickly initialize a new Node.js project with predefined template files.
- Install project dependencies and development dependencies automatically.
- Run a custom development script (`yarn dev`) after project setup for immediate development.

## Installation

You can install Leyajs globally using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install -g leyajs
```

or

```bash
yarn global add leyajs
```

## Usage

To initialize a new Node.js project, simply run the following command in your desired directory:

```bash
leya init
```

This will create a new project directory, copy template files, install dependencies, and run the `yarn dev` command to start development.
